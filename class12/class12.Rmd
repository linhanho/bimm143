## PDB Statistics

Here we inspect the types of structures in the main databse for 3D biomolecular data - the PDB.

> Q1: Determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. 

```{r}
# read in file
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
stats

# calculate percentage values asked for
ans <- stats$Total/sum(stats$Total)*100
names(ans) <- rownames(stats)
round (ans, 2)

```
X-Ray = 88.95%, electron microscopy = 2.72%

> Q2: Also can you determine what proportion of structures are protein? Aim to have a rendered GitHub
document with working code that yields your answers.

```{r}
# read in file
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
stats

# calculate percentage values asked for
sum(stats$Proteins)/sum(stats$Total)*100

```
92.69%

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many
HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
