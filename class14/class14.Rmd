## Analyze RNA-seq by genotype results

Here we read the results of RNA-seq for about ~230 samples (people) with different genotypes for the rs8067378 Asthma associated SNP.

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```

Extract the A/A rows, i.e. where the $geno is equal to "A/A"
```{r}
inds <- expr$geno == "A/A"
expr[inds,]
```
Calculate the different boxplots values
```{r}
summary(expr[inds,]$exp)
```

Extract the G/G rows
```{r}
inds <- expr$geno == "G/G"
expr[inds,]
```
Calculate the different boxplots values
```{r}
summary(expr[inds,]$exp)
```

Make a boxplot
```{r}
boxplot(exp~geno, data = expr, notch=TRUE)
#if the notches don't overlap, this indicates that the data is statistically significant
```
